## Node Module System

### Answer_1
- [x] Monolithic architecture are single-tiered, self-contained traditional unified model for the design of a software program, wherein the program's components or functions are tightly coupled (multiple components are combined into one large application). Due to how it is structured, each component and its associated components must all be present for code to be executed or compiled and for the software to run.

### Answer_2
- [x] Microservices are both an architecture as well an approach to writing software. In this approach to developing softwares, applications are broken down into their smallest components, independent from each other. Instead of a traditional, monolithic, approach, where everything is built into a single piece, microservices are all separated and work together to accomplish the same tasks. Each of these components, or processes, is a microservice. It is a major component of optimizing application development towards a cloud-native model. It is the opposite of and addresses most issues faced when using monolithic architecture.

### Answer_3
Microservices appeals to me more. This is because microservices architecture separates the functionalities of a software into many distinct units, allowing these units to operate entirely on their own. It make it easy to add new functions to a section of software without affecting the entire software. Compared to monolithic apps, microservices are easier to build, test, deploy, and update.
