## Node Module System

### Answer_1
- [x] Monolithic architecture are single-tiered, self-contained traditional unified model for the design of a software program, wherein the program's components or functions are tightly coupled (multiple components are combined into one large application). Due to how it is structured, each component and its associated components must all be present for code to be executed or compiled and for the software to run.

### Answer_2
- [x] Microservices are both an architecture as well an approach to writing software. In this approach to developing softwares, applications are broken down into their smallest components, independent from each other. Instead of a traditional, monolithic, approach, where everything is built into a single piece, microservices are all separated and work together to accomplish the same tasks. Each of these components, or processes, is a microservice. It is a major component of optimizing application development towards a cloud-native model. It is the opposite of and addresses most issues faced when using monolithic architecture.

### Answer_3
Microservices architecture separates the functionalities of a website into many distinct units, allowing these units to operate entirely on their own. This allows programmers to add new functions to their websites without programming their interactions with other elements on the website. For instance, an e-commerce website that uses microservices architecture may run transactions and gather price data from two distinct entities with their own frameworks, logic and APIs.

Compared to monolithic apps, microservices are easier to build, test, deploy, and update. Red Hat believes it is the answer to the question: how can my business react faster to new demands, rather than being stuck in the multiyear "death march" of traditional software development? Now, different parts of your development team can work concurrently on your products, in an agile manner, and deliver value to your customers immediately.

Microservices are both an architecture and an approach to writing software. With microservices, applications are broken down into their smallest components, independent from each other. Instead of a traditional, monolithic, approach to apps, where everything is built into a single piece, microservices are all separated and work together to accomplish the same tasks. Each of these components, or processes, is a microservice. This approach to software development values granularity, being lightweight, and the ability to share similar process across multiple apps. It is a major component of optimizing application development towards a cloud-native model.

But the bigger question here is why you'd want to use a microservice-based infrastructure. The goal is, simply put, to deliver quality software, faster. Using microservices is a means to that end, but there are other considerations too. Breaking your apps into microservices isnâ€™t enough, you've got to manage them, orchestrate them, and deal with the data they create and modify.
